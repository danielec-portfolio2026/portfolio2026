    <p>
      F&ograve;&nbsp;Gineer ch’&egrave;&nbsp;Sci&agrave;&nbsp;Febreer is a winter festival held in Moggio, a small
      mountain village in the Valsassina valley in northern Italy. The ritual takes
      place outdoors at night during the coldest period of the year and uses fire,
      noise and collective presence to mark a transition from winter toward renewal.
      The goal of this project was to translate the atmosphere and spatial qualities
      of the ritual into two elements: a poster and a temporary entrance structure
      conceived at scale. Rather than designing a permanent object, the focus was on
      creating a spatial condition that could coexist with the landscape and disappear
      once the ritual ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire, darkness and human scale were treated as primary design elements. The
      poster explores this contrast: darkness as a dominant condition interrupted by
      concentrated points of light. The imagery abstracts the presence of fire and
      gathering into blurred forms, allowing ambiguity and depth to guide
      interpretation. The entrance acts as a threshold between the surrounding
      darkness and the ritual space. From the outside the structure appears compact
      and opaque, gradually opening toward the interior where fire and gathering
      take place. Rather than functioning as a gateway, it becomes a slow spatial
      transition preparing the body to move from exposure into collective warmth.
